            "1. Technical Challenges: Scriabin's piano sonatas are notoriously difficult. They require a high level of technical proficiency, including fast tempos, complex rhythms, and extensive use of the entire keyboard. The physical demands of these pieces can be taxing even for accomplished pianists.\n",
